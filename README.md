## General

- BorderModes are Inset (easier to reason about padding etc)
- Anchors/Positions/Sizes are generally 0/1 by default (simpler to nest into components)
- Some -Color3 properties are available as -ColorStyle from Enum.StudioStyleGuideColor
- State hoisted as far up as possible, e.g. Collapsibles (make components flexible - use a HOC if self-managing behavior needed)
- Which ones take children?
- Which ones forward arbitrary instance props?
